# Requirements
- I used only Standard libary packages, so I believe you just need the same
  version of Go as me: "go version go1.9 darwin/amd64"

- Here's the list of packages just in case
  + "bufio"
  + "encoding/json"
  + "flag"
  + "fmt"
  + "log"
  + "net"
  + "os"
  + "strconv"
  + "strings"
  + "sync"
  + "time"
